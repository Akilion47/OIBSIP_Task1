# OnlineReservationSystem

The code represents an online reservation system implemented in Java. It allows users to log in, make train reservations, and cancel existing reservations. Here's an overview of the code's functionality:

- The `main` method serves as the entry point for the program. It prompts the user to enter their username and password for authentication.
- If the user's credentials are authenticated successfully, they are granted access to the system.
- The user is then presented with a menu of options: Reservation Form or Cancellation Form.
- Based on the user's choice, the code either calls the `showReservationForm` or `showCancellationForm` methods.
- In the `showReservationForm` method, the user is prompted to enter their name, train number, class type, date of journey, from place, and destination. The entered details are then processed (e.g., saved to a database) and a success message is displayed.
- In the `showCancellationForm` method, the user is prompted to enter their PNR number to retrieve the reservation details from the database. The code then asks for confirmation before proceeding with the cancellation. If confirmed, the reservation is deleted (or appropriate operations are performed) and a confirmation message is displayed.

It's important to note that the code provided is a simplified representation of an online reservation system and does not include actual database integration or error handling beyond basic validation. It serves as a starting point and can be further extended to incorporate additional features and functionalities as required.
